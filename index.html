      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>In the golden light of autumn, surrounded by trees dressed in amber and gold, I stand with my loved ones, embracing the quiet beauty of nature's change. Each season reminds me of growth, of purpose, and of the joy found in togetherness. My name is Armando Rebaza, and this moment reflects the heart of who I am. A Computer Engineer by training, a Finance Manager by profession, and a lifelong learner by passion. Faith, family, and service guide my steps, both in life and in the digital world I now explore. Welcome to my journey â€” where code meets connection, and learning becomes legacy.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I enjoy working on projects around the houseâ€”both inside and outside. Whether it is organizing a space, improving something functional, or simply creating a more inviting environment, I find joy in making our home a place of peace and purpose. These hands-on projects help me stay grounded and creative while also providing a sense of accomplishment.</p>
